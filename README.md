# Curriculum 0.1
Hello guys!

My name is Pedro Miguel, I'm 26 years old, ESL teacher in Brazil for 3 years already, and passionate by coding.

I've done a Technical Coding Course while I was in college, which made me love it as a hobby. More or less 4 years later,
I decided to start studying codes again - fell in love with Front-End programming - and then after a brief (kinda dumb) 
insight, I had the idea of put in practice my knowledge in a Curriculum page.

This page is goind to be used for me to get another job. 

I organized the HTML and the CSS Layout acording to my ideas.

I decided to share it in order to get more sugestions - because, seriously, I'm almost out of it.

Now I'm looking for some ideas to improve it - necessarily I want to later redo it with Bootstrap - and also need help with 
a Form where people can send me their contacts, or, even better, a job proposal!!
